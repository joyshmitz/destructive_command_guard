Protects against destructive rsync operations like --delete and its variants.

### Keywords

Commands containing these keywords are checked against this pack:

- `rsync`

### Safe Patterns (Allowed)

These patterns match safe commands that are always allowed:

| Pattern Name | Pattern |
|--------------|----------|
| `rsync-dry-run` | `rsync\b.*\s--dry-run\b` |

| Pattern Name | Reason | Severity |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| `rsync-delete` | rsync --delete removes destination files not present in source. | high |
| `rsync-del-short` | rsync --del is a short alias for --delete and is destructive. | high |

### Allowlist Guidance

To allowlist a specific rule from this pack, add to your allowlist:

```toml
[[allow]]
rule = "remote.rsync:<pattern-name>"
reason = "Your reason here"
```

To allowlist all rules from this pack (use with caution):

```toml
[[allow]]
rule = "remote.rsync:*"
reason = "Your reason here"
risk_acknowledged = true
```
