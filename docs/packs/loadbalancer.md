## HAProxy

**Pack ID:** `loadbalancer.haproxy`

Protects against destructive HAProxy load balancer operations like stopping the service or disabling backends via runtime API.

### Keywords

Commands containing these keywords are checked against this pack:

- `haproxy`
- `socat`

### Safe Patterns (Allowed)

These patterns match safe commands that are always allowed:

| Pattern Name | Pattern |

### Destructive Patterns (Blocked)

These patterns match potentially destructive commands:

| Pattern Name | Reason | Severity |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| `haproxy-soft-stop` | haproxy -sf sends a soft stop signal, terminating the load balancer gracefully. | high |
| `haproxy-hard-stop` | haproxy -st sends a hard stop signal, immediately terminating the load balancer. | high |
| `haproxy-systemctl-stop` | systemctl stop haproxy stops the HAProxy service. | high |
| `haproxy-service-stop` | service haproxy stop stops the HAProxy service. | high |
| `haproxy-socat-disable-server` | Disabling a server via HAProxy runtime API removes it from the load balancer pool. | high |

### Allowlist Guidance

To allowlist a specific rule from this pack, add to your allowlist:

```toml
[[allow]]
rule = "loadbalancer.haproxy:<pattern-name>"
reason = "Your reason here"
```

To allowlist all rules from this pack (use with caution):

```toml
[[allow]]
rule = "loadbalancer.haproxy:*"
reason = "Your reason here"
risk_acknowledged = true
```
