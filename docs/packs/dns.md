## Cloudflare DNS

**Pack ID:** `dns.cloudflare`

Protects against destructive Cloudflare DNS operations like record deletion, zone deletion, and targeted Terraform destroy.

### Keywords

Commands containing these keywords are checked against this pack:

- `wrangler`

- `dns-records`

### Safe Patterns (Allowed)

These patterns match safe commands that are always allowed:

| `cloudflare-api-get` | `curl\b.*\s-X\s*GET\b.*\bapi\.cloudflare\.com\b` |

### Destructive Patterns (Blocked)

These patterns match potentially destructive commands:

| Pattern Name | Reason | Severity |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| `cloudflare-wrangler-dns-delete` | wrangler dns-records delete removes a Cloudflare DNS record. | high |
| `cloudflare-api-delete-dns-record` | curl -X DELETE against /dns_records/{id} deletes a Cloudflare DNS record. | high |
| `cloudflare-api-delete-zone` | curl -X DELETE against /zones/{id} deletes a Cloudflare zone. | high |
| `cloudflare-terraform-destroy-record` | terraform destroy -target=cloudflare_record deletes specific DNS records. | high |

### Allowlist Guidance

To allowlist a specific rule from this pack, add to your allowlist:

```toml
[[allow]]
rule = "dns.cloudflare:<pattern-name>"
reason = "Your reason here"
```

To allowlist all rules from this pack (use with caution):

```toml
[[allow]]
rule = "dns.cloudflare:*"
reason = "Your reason here"
risk_acknowledged = true
