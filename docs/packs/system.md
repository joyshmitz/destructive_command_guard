### Allowlist Guidance

To allowlist a specific rule from this pack, add to your allowlist:

```toml
[[allow]]
rule = "system.disk:<pattern-name>"
reason = "Your reason here"
```

To allowlist all rules from this pack (use with caution):

```toml
[[allow]]
rule = "system.disk:*"
reason = "Your reason here"
risk_acknowledged = true
```

### Allowlist Guidance

To allowlist a specific rule from this pack, add to your allowlist:
