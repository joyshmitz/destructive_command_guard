## Elasticsearch

**Pack ID:** `search.elasticsearch`

Protects against destructive Elasticsearch REST API operations like index deletion, delete-by-query, index close, and cluster setting changes.

### Keywords

Commands containing these keywords are checked against this pack:

- `elasticsearch`
- `curl`
- `http`
- `9200`
- `_search`
- `_cluster`
- `_cat`
- `_doc`
- `_all`
- `_delete_by_query`

### Safe Patterns (Allowed)

These patterns match safe commands that are always allowed:

| Pattern Name | Pattern |
|--------------|----------|
| `es-curl-get-search` | `curl\b.*-X\s*GET\b.*\b(?:https?://)?[^\s'\"]*(?:elastic\|:9200)[^\s'\"]*/(?:[^\s/]+/)?(?:_search\|_count\|_mapping\|_settings)\b` |
| `es-curl-get-cat` | `curl\b.*-X\s*GET\b.*\b(?:https?://)?[^\s'\"]*(?:elastic\|:9200)[^\s'\"]*/_cat/\S+` |
| `es-curl-get-cluster-health` | `curl\b.*-X\s*GET\b.*\b(?:https?://)?[^\s'\"]*(?:elastic\|:9200)[^\s'\"]*/_cluster/health\b` |

| `es-http-get-cluster-health` | `http\s+GET\s+(?:https?://)?\S*(?:elastic\|:9200)\S*/_cluster/health\b` |

### Destructive Patterns (Blocked)

These patterns match potentially destructive commands:

| `es-curl-close-index` | curl -X POST to _close closes an index, making it unavailable for reads/writes. | high |
| `es-curl-delete-index` | curl -X DELETE against an Elasticsearch index (or _all/*) deletes data permanently. | high |
| `es-curl-cluster-settings` | curl -X PUT to /_cluster/settings changes cluster settings and can be dangerous. | high |
| `es-http-delete-doc` | http DELETE against /_doc deletes a document from Elasticsearch. | high |
| `es-http-delete-by-query` | http POST to _delete_by_query deletes documents matching the query. | high |
